# House-price-prediction
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of houses based on various features like square footage, number of rooms, and more. The dataset used for this project is the King County House Sales Dataset, which contains information about house sales in the King County area (Seattle, USA).

In this project, we have implemented two popular machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. We compare their performance and evaluate the model accuracy using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² (R-squared).

The project also includes a web application built using Streamlit to allow users to input house features and get predicted house prices in real-time.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Model Training: Trained models using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² score.
Web App with Streamlit: A simple user interface that allows users to input house features and predict prices using the trained models.
Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for building the machine learning models and web app.
Scikit-learn: Library used for implementing machine learning models and preprocessing techniques.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Library used for visualizing model performance and comparison.
Streamlit: Framework for creating interactive web applications for machine learning models.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method used for regression tasks.
Linear Regression: A simple algorithm used for regression tasks.
